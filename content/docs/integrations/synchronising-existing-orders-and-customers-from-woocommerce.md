Once you have connected your store to Campaignrabbit, all the new orders placed thereafter would automatically be sent.

The data prior to the connection can also be synchronized to Campaignrabbit.

It just takes a single click!  
Just hit the **sync** button in the Campaignrabbit plugin for WooCommerce.

**I see a warning message that the WP-CRON is disabled**

By default, WordPress comes with an internal cron active. This might have been disabled in your site.

In this case, you should by default have a cron job / task set in your hosting cPanel.
* In this case, you will have to manually initiate the synchronisation process by copying the synchronisation url and calling it in a browser window.
* This will initiate a sync and you can see Initial Synchronisation successful.
